# Online Border-Radius Generator
[Online Border-Radius Generator](https://elharony.github.io/Online-Border-Radius-Generator/) is an Online CSS3 Border-Radius Generator Web Application built for lazy Web Developers, just like you! â˜•

## Getting Started
I kept this project as simple as it could be; No Libraries, No Frameworks, No Tools, nothing more than Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so there is nothing impressing on how to use/install it:

- `git clone https://github.com/elharony/Online-Border-Radius-Generator.git`
- `cd Border-Radius.online`
- Open the `index.html` directly, or use A Live Previewer to make it easier to modify the App!
